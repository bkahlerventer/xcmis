eXo Platform provides CMIS support using xCMIS project and WCM Storage provider.

h1. Why CMIS?

Idea of a standard to make it easier to share and manage content and an Organization for the 
Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) technical committee was formed to write a 
formal specification of a Content Management Interoperability (CMIS) standard.

Two mutual targets which caused appearance of the specification:
# Content integration - ensuring of using the content from various repositories, even created by different vendors in a single application, such as the portal, CMS, etc.
# Access unification - a minimum interface provided by content repository to decouple the content storage from the application's business logic.

xCMIS project embedded in Platform to expose WCM drives as CMIS repositories.
CMIS feature is implemented as a set of components deployed on eXo Container using XML files to describe the configuration of the service.
